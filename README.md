# cryptography
Learning cryptography and using c++

Code refactored, planning out challenge 6

Tasks:


for get_key_by_index_of_co:
let the return value for key remain as a bit vector

for bin_to_num:
let it convert one bit vector to one number, rather than sending a whole int vector

for challenge 4, give the option to either send a string or text file

MAKE THEM ALL RETURN A VECTOR OF BITSSS!!!!!!!

fix endline when reading files
